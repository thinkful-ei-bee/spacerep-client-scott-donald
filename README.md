# Spaced Repetition Capstone

The spaced repetition technique is a learning technique where the learner is exposed to new information in increasingly large intervals. Learn more about spaced repetition [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).  In this project, we utilized the spaced repetition technique and built an app that teaches users the Russian variety of the [cyrillic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabets).  Users are asked to translate a cyrillic letter into it's english, Latin alphabet equivalent e.g. (д => d).  Correct answers result in increasingly large gaps before being shown the letter again, while incorrect answers result in seeing that letter more frequently.

Built in 5 days, this full stack project uses a Linked List data structure and was a valuable exercise in team development.
